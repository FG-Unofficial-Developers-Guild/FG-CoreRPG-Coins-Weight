# CoreRPG Coins Weight
This extension calculates coin weight.
It does this by adding a "coins" inventory item of the appropriate weight.
This can be marked uncarried or put into a bag of holding (if using my [extraplanar containers](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?67126-PFRPG-Extraplanar-Containers) extension).
Editing the coinweight.lua file allows setting different weights for different denominations.
The default is 1lb / 50coins.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.10 (2021-02-04).
It has been tested with the CoreRPG, Pathfinder 1e, D&D 3.5E, and 5E rulesets.

Users of [damned](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?19192-damned)'s 5eCoinWeight extension will have carried and uncarried coins (from both columns) brought over seamlessly.
