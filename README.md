# CoreRPG Coins Weight
This extension calculates coin weight.
It does this by adding a "coins" inventory item of the appropriate weight.
This can be marked uncarried or put into a bag of holding (if using my extraplanar containers extension).
Editing the coinweight.lua file allows setting different weights for different denominations.
The default is 1lb / 50coins.
